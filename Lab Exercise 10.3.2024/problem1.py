## Lab Exercise 10/3/2024 Problem 1
## Author: 
## This program will display the force between two charged particles
from math import *

#This function will return the force between 2 charged particles
#and is provided with 3 parameters; charge1, charge2 and distance
#the particles are apart
def coulomb(q1, q2, r):
    #Add code here
    

#Get input from user for charge1, charge2, and distance between charges
#and store in q1, q2, and r as floating point values
#Add code here
    

#Pass parameters to function and print out the force in Newtons
#Add code here




#Charge of proton = 1.6e-19 coulomb
#Charge of electron = -1.6e-19 coulomb


## Two protons seperated by 1 micron will give a
## force of 2.300862064124984e-10 Newtons

##Sample output
##Enter the number of coulombs charge charge 1: 1.6e-16
##Enter the number of coulombs charge charge 2: 1.6e-16
##Enter the distance the charges are seperated (in meters): 1e-6
##2.300862064124984e-10 Newtons
