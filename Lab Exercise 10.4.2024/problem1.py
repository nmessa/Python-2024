## Lab Exercise 10.4.2024 Problem 1
## Author: 
## This program generates a DNA string and reports the percentage of
## GC content
from random import choice

#Define bases as a list
#Add code here


#initialize DNA string to ""
#Add code here


#Initialize count to 0
#Add code here


#Define the number of bases in the string to one million
#Add code here


#build a million base DNA string
#Add code here


#count the G and C bases
#Add code here

        
#Calculate the percentage of C and G bases in the DNA strand
#Add code here


#print the results
print("The percentage of GC material is", round(percent, 2))

##Sample Output
##The percentage of GC material is 40.05
