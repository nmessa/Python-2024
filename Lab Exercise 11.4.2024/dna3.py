## This program demonstrates DNA sequence matching with user validation

    #ADD CODE HERE

#generate a DNA string of one million bases
    #ADD CODE HERE
    
#Enter DNA sequence to search for
    #ADD CODE HERE

if validateSequence(look):
    #search sequence
    #ADD CODE HERE
    
else:
    #print invalid sequence message
