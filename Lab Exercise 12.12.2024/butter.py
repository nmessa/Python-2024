#This program will calculate the thickness of butter is a 1 inch
#cube is spread over a football field

#define the width and length of a football field in inches
#Add code here


#Calculate the area of a football field in square inches
#Add code here

#initialize values for the starting cube
#Add code here

#iterative bisect the cube and calculate the new area until it exceeds the
#area of the football field
#Add code here


#Convert sideLength into nanometers
sideLength = sideLength * 2.54e7
print ("Number of cubes = " + str(numCubes))
print ("Thickness of butter = " + str(sideLength) + " nanometers")

##Output
##Number of cubes = 590295810358705651712
##Thickness of butter = 3.0279159545898438 nanometers
