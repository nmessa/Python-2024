#Create a list to hold all palindromes

#Process each word. Must strip off newline characters
#If the word is a palindrome, increment the count and add to palindromes list
#need to keep track of the length of the longest palindrome
#Add code here


#Output the results

##Output
##There are 83667 words
##There are 107 palindromes
##The longest palindrome has a length of: 8
