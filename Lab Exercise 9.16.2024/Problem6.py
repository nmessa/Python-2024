##Author: 
##Makes change for a given amount of money

#This function will return the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and
#pennies that make up the floating point value passed as a parameter
def makeChange(money):
    #Add code here

    
    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies

#Get the amount of money from user and store in a floating point
#variable money
money = float(input("Enter an amount of money (xx.xx): "))

#Call makeChange function and pass money as a parameter
#makeChange should return 4 values
#Add code here




#Print the returned values
print ("Quarters =", quarters)
print ("Dimes =", dimes)
print ("Nickels =", nickels)
print ("Pennies =", pennies)

## Sample Output
